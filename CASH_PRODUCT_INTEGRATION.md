# 💰 Cash Product - Real Data Integration

## ✅ What Changed

**Cash Product** now shows **real-time data** from BigQuery with two key metrics:
- **Penetration Rate** (Primary metric shown on tile)
- **Active Cash Product Users** (Shown as additional context)

---

## 📊 What Is Being Tracked

### Primary Metric: Cash Product Penetration Rate
**Formula:**
```
Penetration Rate = (Active Cash Product Users / Total AEPS Users) × 100
```

**Definition:**
- What % of your AEPS users are also using cash products (DMT, CMS, BBPS, Recharge)
- Shows cross-sell effectiveness
- Higher = Better product adoption

### Supporting Metric: Active Cash Product Users
**Definition:**
- Count of unique agents with any cash product transactions in the current month
- Shows absolute usage

---

## 💵 Cash Products Included

The metric tracks these 4 cash products:

1. **DMT** (Domestic Money Transfer)
2. **CMS** (Cash Management Services)
3. **BBPS** (Bharat Bill Payment System)
4. **Recharge** (Mobile/DTH recharges)

**Data Source:** BigQuery `csp_monthly_timeline` table

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Calculation:

```sql
Active Cash Users = COUNT(DISTINCT agents WHERE 
  dmt_gtv > 0 OR 
  cms_gtv > 0 OR 
  bbps_gtv > 0 OR 
  recharge_gtv > 0
)

Total AEPS Users = COUNT(DISTINCT agents WHERE aeps_gtv > 0)

Penetration Rate = (Active Cash Users / Total AEPS Users) × 100
```

### Example:
- **Total AEPS Users:** 100,000 agents
- **Active Cash Product Users:** 85,000 agents
- **Penetration Rate:** 85.0%

This means 85% of your AEPS users are also using at least one cash product.

## 🚦 Dashboard Status Colors

| Penetration Rate | Status | Color | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------|-------|---------|
| ≥ 90% | Green | 🟢 | Excellent cross-sell |
| 75-89% | Yellow | 🟡 | Good, room to improve |
| < 75% | Red | 🔴 | Low adoption, needs attention |

### Trend Indicator:
- **↑ Up:** Penetration increased vs last month
- **↓ Down:** Penetration decreased vs last month  
- **→ Stable:** No change (±0% vs last month)

## 🔍 Business Insights

### High Penetration (>90%) ✅
- Strong cross-sell strategy working
- Agents are multi-product users
- Good revenue diversification

### Medium Penetration (75-89%) ⚠️
- Decent adoption but can improve
- Focus on training/incentives
- Target AEPS-only users

### Low Penetration (<75%) 🔴
- Weak cross-sell
- Most agents only using AEPS
- Need product awareness campaigns

---

## 📊 Sample Dashboard Output

### Scenario 1: High Performing
```
Cash Product: 92.5% 🟢
↑ +1.8%
95,420 active cash product users
```
**Interpretation:** Excellent! 92.5% of AEPS users are using cash products, and it's growing.

### Scenario 2: Needs Improvement
```
Cash Product: 68.3% 🔴
↓ -3.2%
45,200 active cash product users
```
**Interpretation:** Alert! Only 68% penetration and declining. Need to activate more users.

## 💡 What Makes This Useful

### Before (Dummy Data):
- ❌ Static value: 95.1%
- ❌ No real insights
- ❌ Couldn't track trends
- ❌ No user counts

### After (Real Data):
- ✅ Real penetration rate updated monthly
- ✅ Shows actual active user count
- ✅ Tracks month-over-month changes
- ✅ Actionable business intelligence

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Cross-Sell Performance
**Question:** "How well are we cross-selling cash products to AEPS users?"  
**Answer:** Check the penetration rate - higher is better

### 2. Growth Tracking
**Question:** "Is cash product adoption growing or shrinking?"  
**Answer:** Watch the trend indicator (↑ or ↓)

### 3. Campaign Effectiveness
**Question:** "Did our recent cash product campaign work?"  
**Answer:** Compare penetration before vs after campaign

### 4. User Activation
**Question:** "How many agents are we successfully activating on cash products?"  
**Answer:** Check the active users count

## 🔧 Technical Details

### BigQuery Query Structure:
```sql
WITH monthly_data AS (
  -- Get agent-level cash and AEPS activity
  SELECT agent_id, 
         SUM(dmt + cms + bbps + recharge) AS cash_gtv,
         SUM(aeps_gtv) AS aeps_gtv
  FROM csp_monthly_timeline
  GROUP BY agent_id
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN cash_gtv > 0 THEN agent_id END) AS active_cash_users,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN aeps_gtv > 0 THEN agent_id END) AS total_aeps_users,
  ROUND(SAFE_DIVIDE(cash_users, aeps_users) * 100, 1) AS penetration_rate
FROM monthly_data
```

### Function: `get_cash_product_analytics()`
- **Cache:** 1 hour (ttl=3600)
- **Returns:** DataFrame with month-wise penetration data
- **Fallback:** Uses dummy data if BigQuery unavailable
