# Google Sheets Integration Fix ‚úÖ

## What Was the Problem?

After adding BigQuery credentials to Streamlit secrets, you saw this error:
```
‚ùå Google Sheets access failed for 'login Success Rate': 
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'credentials.json'
```

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Created a Google Sheets Client Helper Function**
- Added `get_google_sheets_client()` function that works with both:
  - ‚úÖ Streamlit Cloud secrets (for production)
  - ‚úÖ Local `credentials.json` file (for development)

### 2. **Updated Google Sheets Functions**
Fixed two functions that were trying to load `credentials.json`:
- `get_anomaly_data_from_sheets()` - For anomaly detection dashboard
- `get_google_sheets_data()` - For login success rate and other sheets data

### 3. **Uses Same Service Account**
The same GCP service account credentials you added for BigQuery will also work for Google Sheets!

## What You Need to Do (2 Minutes)

### ‚úÖ The code fix is already deployed!
Streamlit Cloud is automatically deploying the updated code from GitHub. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete.

### üîë Share Google Sheets with Service Account

**CRITICAL STEP:** You need to give the service account access to your Google Sheets:

#### Sheet 1: Anomaly Dashboard
1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HaW-pC5niZNm0_ii4zoXG-xR781dmDmbPjQf6W_b7Y8
2. Click **Share** (top right corner)
3. Add this email: `mrunalinee-patole@spicemoney-dwh.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Set permission to: **Viewer** (or Editor if you need write access)
5. Click **Send**

#### Sheet 2: Login Data
1. Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XyTNR14JlkM_7uHEeoQa68mLgeiAZTaCq9vR-VCff4o
2. Click **Share** (top right corner)
3. Add this email: `mrunalinee-patole@spicemoney-dwh.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
4. Set permission to: **Viewer** (or Editor if you need write access)
5. Click **Send**

### üì± Verify It Works
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for Streamlit to deploy the changes
2. Visit your app: https://healthdashboardgit-kc5zbc5mqhc6r8i3yasf7y.streamlit.app/
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. You should see:
   - ‚úÖ No more "credentials.json" errors
   - ‚úÖ BigQuery connection successful
   - ‚úÖ Google Sheets data loading properly

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken on Streamlit Cloud):
```python
# ‚ùå Tried to load local file
gc = pygsheets.authorize(service_file='credentials.json')
```

### After (Works Everywhere):
```python
# ‚úÖ Uses Streamlit secrets on cloud, file locally
gc = get_google_sheets_client()
# Automatically detects environment and loads credentials
```

---

## üîí Security

‚úÖ **Same security benefits:**
- One set of credentials works for both BigQuery and Google Sheets
- Credentials stored securely in Streamlit secrets
- No credential files committed to Git

‚úÖ **Service Account Permissions:**
The service account needs access to:
- BigQuery: Read data from your DWH ‚úÖ (already working)
- Google Sheets: Read data from shared sheets ‚ö†Ô∏è (need to share sheets)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Permission denied" or "Access to the spreadsheet is denied"
**Solution:** Make sure you shared the Google Sheets with the service account email (see steps above)

### Error: "Worksheet 'Dashboard' not found"
**Solution:** Check that the worksheet tab name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Still seeing "credentials.json" error?
**Solution:** 
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Streamlit Cloud to deploy the new code
2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check Streamlit Cloud logs for deployment status

### Google Sheets loading slowly?
**Solution:** The data is cached for 30 minutes. First load might be slow, subsequent loads will be instant.

## Summary

### What Changed:
- ‚úÖ Code updated to use Streamlit secrets for Google Sheets
- ‚úÖ Same GCP credentials work for both BigQuery and Sheets
- ‚úÖ Automatic detection of local vs cloud environment
- ‚úÖ Changes pushed to GitHub and auto-deploying

### What You Need to Do:
1. ‚è∞ Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
2. üîë Share Google Sheets with service account email (see above)
3. üéâ Enjoy your working dashboard!
